# Sensor Data Cleaning and Inference

## 🔍 Objective

Clean and analyze sensor data measuring temperature and air quality. Apply statistical inference to detect distributional characteristics and make group comparisons.

## 📁 Data Used

- Simulated sensor data from classroom assignment

## 🧪 Methods Applied

- Outlier detection
- Normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk)
- Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests
- ANOVA and F-test
- Dimensionality reduction: correlation filtering

## 📌 Key Insights

- Non-normality led to use of non-parametric tests.
- Temperature readings differ significantly across zones.
